# ducky - esc -> \
    # So anyways on the send layer hold I think it's fn+alt+tab to get into macro recording.
    # Press esc then press fn+esc (be careful that fn is pressed first).
    # Press FN+alt. You should be in record mode still, probably with esc lit up.
    # Press FN+esc (when you press fn the lighting around esc should disappear) then press esc.
    # Then press fn+alt. Then probably fn+alt+tab to leave recording mode.
