# dotfiles

Almost all the config files I use in my machines.

## Info

- My macOS dotfiles are under the directory **mac**
- In macOS I try to simulate a Tiling Window Manager with the following:
  - [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) (managing windows position and size)
  - [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) (keybindings)
  - [limelight](https://github.com/koekeishiya/limelight) (window borders)
  - zsh aliases `wmstart` and `wmstop` to activate and deactivate the Tiling Window Manager mode
